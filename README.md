### Abstract
Thermal acclimation effects on locomotory performance have been widely documented for macroscopic organisms, but such responses remain largely unexplored in microorganisms. Metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) predicts faster responses in smaller organisms, with potential consequences for host-parasite interactions in variable temperature environments. We investigated thermal acclimation effects on zoospores from the amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), quantifying: (1) thermal performance for maximum zoospore velocity and (2) high temperatures needed to immobilize 50% (〖CT〗_max^50) or 100% (〖CT〗_max^100) of zoospores. We obtained measurements within 18 minutes following a temperature shift from one of three experimental acclimation temperatures. We found possible experimental a evidence ofsignificant curvilinear acclimation effects on maximum zoospore velocity and positive effect of performance temperature on zoospore velocity but no clear effects of experimental acclimation, except for a curvilinear effect on 〖CT〗_max^50, although the latter that  pattern appears tomightmight have have been driven by a confoundment with zoospore density. However, wWe also observed a significant positive effect of the trial start temperature on 〖CT〗_max^50, consistent with a rapid acclimation response to the start temperature on a time scale of ~1–6 minutes (i.e., too rapid for our experimental acclimation treatments to detect), implying that.  zZoospores  〖CT〗_maxeither have constitutive thermal heat responses tolerance (i.e., no acclimation) or fully acclimate 〖CT〗_max to new temperatures within ~10 minutes of a shift. To explore the plausibility of such a rapid response, we analyzed published 〖CT〗_max acclimation times for  potential amphibian hostsmulticellularmacroscopic eukaryotes, and resulting in a predicted  an interquartile range of 3.11–25.98 minutes calculated MTE-predicted acclimation times of  1.38–16.72 minutes when mass scaled to the size of a Bd zoospore. We concludedTaken together, these results suggest that Bd zoospores mightdo exhibit thermal acclimation effects on locomotory performanceresponse on the rapid time scale predicted by MTE. s  Thus , either of which might provideBd might have, possibly giving Bd an advantage over slower-acclimating hosts in variable temperature environments.
