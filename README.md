### Abstract
Thermal acclimation effects on locomotory performance have been widely documented for macroscopic organisms, but such responses remain largely unexplored in microorganisms. Metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) predicts faster responses in smaller organisms, with potential consequences for host-parasite interactions in variable temperature environments. We investigated thermal acclimation effects on zoospores from the amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), quantifying: (1) thermal performance for maximum zoospore velocity and (2) high temperatures needed to immobilize 50% (〖CT〗_max^50) or 100% (〖CT〗_max^100) of zoospores. We obtained measurements within 18 minutes following a shift from one of three experimental acclimation temperatures. We found a positive effect of performance temperature on zoospore velocity but no clear effects of experimental acclimation, except for a curvilinear effect on 〖CT〗_max^50 that might have been driven by a confoundment with zoospore density. However, we observed a significant positive effect of the trial start temperature on 〖CT〗_max^50, consistent with a rapid acclimation response to the start temperature on a time scale of ~1–6 minutes (i.e., too rapid for our experimental acclimation treatments to detect). To explore the plausibility of such a rapid response, we analyzed published acclimation times for potential amphibian hosts and calculated MTE-predicted acclimation times of  1.38–16.72 minutes when scaled to the size of a zoospore. We concluded that Bd zoospores either have constitutive thermal responses (i.e., no acclimation) or fully acclimate to new temperatures within ~10 minutes of a shift, either of which might provide an advantage over slow-acclimating hosts in variable temperature environments.
